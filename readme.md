### Quick Guide: 

To use ROS, everytime you open a terminal you will need to run: 
>source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash  
  
>. install/setup.bash   *do this every time   
 
>export ROS_ImagePath=/home/yourUsername/Desktop/lame_photos/an_image


Or add it the bashrc script to automatically, run this once:  
>echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc  

>echo "export ROS_ImagePath=/home/yourUsername/Desktop/lame_photos/an_image" >> ~/.bashrc
