## YOLO Model Training and Testing Ground


# This branch is completely seperate from the rest of the repo! Do not check it out on your normal workspace!

This branch is meant to be used seperately to hold the training data and test scripts.




data.yaml had some issues with the relative paths to Train,Valid, and Test

I had to switch this to an absolute path on my machine. If you want to run this make sure to change them for your machine
